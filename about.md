[&laquo;&nbsp;back to blog](/)

I'm a software product guy. I've worked as a product manager and engineer in
big and small companies, freelanced, started a company of my own, and
launched dozens of products. I work as a consultant helping
companies with product and engineering management challenges. Previously I
was CTO at [Happie](http://gethappie.me), managed products at
[PatientsLikeMe](http://patientslikeme.com) and
[Smarterer](http://smarterer.com), and held a range of engineering
positions.

When I'm not making software products, I'm usually spending time with my two
kids, Clara and Aaron, and my wonderful wife Nicole. I also enjoy home
improvement, improv comedy, and ice cream.
