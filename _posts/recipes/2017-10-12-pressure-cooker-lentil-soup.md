A few quick notes on a solid red+green lentil recipe, cooked quickly in the pressure cooker.

The recipe is here:

* [Eat Within Your Means: Pressure Cooker Lentil Soup](http://eatwithinyourmeans.com/pressure-cooker-lentil-soup/)

Notes on cooking it:

* Benefits from some meat for variety/flavor. I've tried sausage, thick-cut salt pork, and chicken, all good.
* Cut down on the paprika (to one-third or less of usual) for kids.
* Potatoes are optional.
* Cabbage is great. Saute it with the other veg.
* Extra celery is good.
* All the water tends to get absorbed into the lentil mass. It might be good to add enough that you actually get soup rather than stew, but I'm not sure I have room for that.
