My tested version of the basic staple.

TLDR: 1c rinsed rice + 1c water, high pressure for 15min, 10min natural release.

Prep time: about 3 minutes.

Cook time: about 25 minutes.

### Ingredients
* 1 cup long grain brown rice
* 1 to 1 1/4 cups water

### Directions
* Rinse rice and drain. (If you aren't rinsing the rice, use more water - 1 1/4 cups; if you're rinsing thoroughly, use just 1 cup.)
* Add rice and water to Instant Pot.
* Cook for 15min on manual high pressure.
* Allow 10 minutes after cooking ("natural release")
* Once the keep-warm timer shows 10m, release pressure, open lid, fluff, and serve.

Note: The ratio of rice/water may need tweaking if you're scaling up.
