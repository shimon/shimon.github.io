### Ingredients

* 200g sour cream
* 2 cups of sugar (recipe calls for 2 middle-size glasses, which are ~6oz, which mom says is a lot)
* 200g margarine or butter
* 2T vegetable oil
* 1/2t baking soda, activated with a bit (~1T) of vinegar
* 2 eggs
* 200g raisins
* Vanilla extract or other flavoring
* Flour - until it achieves the texture of thick sour cream

### Assembly

In a mixing bowl, combine (in this order):

* Sour cream
* 2 eggs
* sugar
* raisins
* vanilla
* vegetable oil

Then melt the butter, not too much - cool it off. Pour in a thin stream into bowl, mixing constantly.

[Ed: There is no mention of when to add the flour or baking soda.]

Don't forget to set aside a piece for me, OK? Kisses, Y.M.

Start the oven at 350-400F. When the batter rises, immediately turn down to 300F.

Bake in a hot bundt pan, well coated with butter.
