Prep time: about 20 minutes.

Cook time: 20 hours.

Temperatures: Cook sous vide at 131F. Finish in 450F convection oven for 7-8 minutes.

### Ingredients

For the sous vide cook:

* 1 roast, 3-4 lb (I used a top sirloin roast from the local butcher shop and it turned out fantastic. Thicker cuts are preferred.)
* Rosemary (fresh or dried)
* Thyme (fresh or dried)
* Garlic powder
* Salt and pepper (not too much salt, it's not needed and could ruin the jus)
* 1-2T butter

For the finishing rub:

* 8 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1T each Rosemary, thyme, or other herbs
* 1T Cumin and/or other spices
* ~5T Olive oil

Try next time: horseradish (especially in the finishing rub).


### Cooking

Rinse and dry meat. Coat with S&P, herbs, spices. Bag with butter. Sous vide at 131F for 12-24 hours (I did about 20h).

Before serving, preheat oven to 450F/convection. This is also a good temperature for roasting oiled/seasoned veg, like halved small potatoes (~25min) or broccoli (~10min).

Combine rub ingredients in a bowl.

Remove roast from sous vide bag, saving juices for serving with the meat. Pat dry with paper towels. Cover with wet rub. Place on roasting rack or baking tray in oven. Cook until a nice crust forms, about 7-8min.

### Serving

Slice thin. Plate with a spoonful of jus.
