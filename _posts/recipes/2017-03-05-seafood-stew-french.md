Cook time: about 25 minutes.

### Ingredients

* 1 lb seafood medley, thawed (shrimp mussels calamari scallops)
* 2 ribs celery
* 1 medium-large onion
* 1 lemon, quartered and seeded
* 3 cloves garlic
* 2 cups fish stock
* 3 tsp flour
* 3 Tbsp butter
* 1/2 cup milk
* 2 tsp capers
* 4-6 slices preserved lemon, minced

### Cooking

Heat olive oil in a pan on high. Add seafood, S&P, 1/3 of garlic. Brown for flavoring. Remove from heat.

In a pot, start stew base. Heat olive oil on medium-high. Add celery, onion, 2/3 of garlic, S&P. Cook until softened.

Add seafood and stock to stew. Retain pan. Reduce heat to simmer.

In reserved pan, add butter and melt on medium heat. Scrape fond into butter. Once melted, add flour (sprinkling to distribute). Brown slightly to form roux, about 30s-1m. Once browned and smelling nutty, add milk. Stir to absorb fond and homogenize. Add mixture to stew.

Add capers and preserved lemon.

Simmer to thicken as desired, at least a few minutes. S&P to taste.

Serve as a rich bisque or stew over rice.
